Observations developping 0xed with nuklear

* Text is blurry
Text rendering is not sharp like windows/Qt rendering

* Styling
Variable naming is not directly understandable
Many vars are in the window style ?
Many options are missing (such as border_hover border_active)
style.combo.symbol_normal does nothing, see nk_draw_button_symbol()

* Layout
There seem to be a lot of 1 pixel padding everywhere even with every padding set to zero
Arbitrarily placing widgets is not made easy
Borders are not always part of the widget box and thus overdrawn on
Borders should be part of padding

* Behavior
Menu behavior is weird and feeld hacked in. Clicking on a menu label is like clicking on a button and opening a contextual menu,
but instead the label should stay active and allow with a simple mouse motion to open the other menus.
Combo is not "active" while open (same as menu)

* API naming
NK_TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER, NK_TEXT_ALIGN_MIDDLE, NK_TEXT_CENTERED? Which is which?
It should be: NK_TEXT_ALIGN_HCENTER, NK_TEXT_ALIGN_VCENTER, NK_TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER

* Scrollbars
You can't specify if you want only one type of scrollbar (vertical / horizontal)
Window view is cropped even if there is no visible scrollbar if you don't specify NK_WINDOW_NO_SCROLLBAR
No custom scrollbar support
