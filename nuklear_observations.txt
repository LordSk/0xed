Observations developping 0xed with nuklear

* Text is blurry
Text rendering is not sharp like windows/Qt rendering

* Styling is very confusing:
Variable naming is not directly understandable
Many vars are in the window style ?
Many options are missing

* Layout
There seem to be a lot of 1 pixel padding everywhere even with every padding set to zero
Arbitrarily placing widgets is not made easy

* Behavior
Menu behavior is weird and feeld hacked in. Clicking on a menu label is like clicking on a button and opening a contextual menu,
but instead the label should stay active and allow with a simple mouse motion to open the other menus.

* API naming
NK_TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER, NK_TEXT_ALIGN_MIDDLE, NK_TEXT_CENTERED? Which is which?
It should be: NK_TEXT_ALIGN_HCENTER, NK_TEXT_ALIGN_VCENTER, NK_TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER

* Scrollbars
You can't specify if you want only one type of scrollbar (vertical / horizontal)
Window view is cropped even if there is no visible scrollbar if you don't specify NK_WINDOW_NO_SCROLLBAR
No custom scrollbar support
No scrollbar buttons for precise scrolling?
